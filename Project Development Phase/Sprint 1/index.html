<h1 align = "center"> Crude Oil Price Prediction</h1>

<div>
<p>
Demand for oil is inelastic, therefore the rise in price is good news for producers because they will see an increase in 
their revenue. Oil importers, however, will experience increased costs of purchasing oil.
Because oil is the largest traded commodity, the effects are guided significant. A rising oil price can even shift 
economic political power from oil importers to oil exporters. The crude oil price movements are subject to diverse 
influencing factors
